During this discovery we worked closely with a number of teams including:

* policy colleagues at the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG)
* a number of local planning authorities
* The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) - most of our findings align with those by [published by CPRE](https://www.cpre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/State_of_Brownfield_2019.pdf)

We identified several main issues with the brownfield land data published by local planning authorities. These findings are not unique to brownfield land data and were informed by our wider discovery into the issues with land and housing data. However, the following areas are particularly prevalent in brownfield land data:

### Inaccessible data (hard to find and use)

Data needed about brownfield land is rarely found online, with many datasets held locally and in widely varying formats, for example in PDF documents. It is particularly difficult to find and use geospatial data, since conservation and other areas are often presented as images, rather than as raw data.

Even where there are regional or national repositories of data, these typically do not link to the actual raw data. Instead they often link to an authority or other data publisher’s homepage, or even to an invalid link.

What’s more, many sites with data have poor search functions, which not only frustrate the user, but make it difficult to collect, analyse and use the data.

### Inconsistent data (hard to find, use and trust)

When data is found, it is often inconsistent. We have found that the same specific types of data are often defined or formatted differently depending on the publisher. This inconsistency exists even where a standard is in place. For example, among the 330 lists made available to meet the [brownfield register standard](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653657/BrownfieldLandRegisters_-_DataStandard.pdf), we found 31 different combinations of file format and character encodings.

In instances that the files could be converted into the correct Comma Separated Value (CSV) format, the files contained blank lines, blank column names, incorrect formatting and other useability issues. This inconsistency makes the data hard to use, analyse or trust enough to build into products and services.

### Inaccurate data (hard to use and trust)

We want to report on the state of brownfield land registers published using MHCLG’s [legislation and data standard](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653657/BrownfieldLandRegisters_-_DataStandard.pdf). Unfortunately, we have learned by collecting and checking the data published by local planning authorities that very few of the registers meet the standard and the data is often not usable.

MHCLG also funded the Local Government Association to develop a [tool to validate brownfield land registers](https://validator.opendata.esd.org.uk/). Whilst this a good idea, the development was limited in scope and we heard of a number of usability issues, such as it not accepting Excel files.

### Data not kept up to date (hard to use and trust)

All of the above issues, combined with local planning authorities not regularly updating their data, leads to a lack of trust in the data on brownfield land.

## Main areas to investigate in alpha:

* Would a national register of brownfield land be valuable?
* Would improved, simple guidance on publishing brownfield land data help local authorities to publish accurate, usable data?
* Would a brownfield land data validator, which checks the accuracy and formatting of the data, help to minimise errors in the data that local planning authorities publish?
* Would a tool to fix errors in the data uploaded to the validator help to minimise errors?
