Brownfield sites are plots of land that have previously been developed but are not currently in use. [Recent analysis](https://www.cpre.org.uk/resources/housing-and-planning/planning/item/5086-state-of-brownfield-2019) suggests more than 1 million houses could be built on brownfield sites across England.

We're working with local planning authorities to improve the quality and availability of data on brownfield sites. We're currently building and testing several resources to help local planning authorities publish and update their data. Join the conversation on our [GitHub issues pages](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/labels/project%3Abrownfield-sites) if you're interested in brownfield site data, or email <DigitalLand@communities.gov.uk>

## Timeline

**[7 October 2019](https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/2019-10-07/#brownfield-sites-https-digital-land-github-io-project-brownfield-sites)**

We explored ways of simplifying the format, based on the collection of 2018 register.

**[4 October 2019](https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/2019-10-04/#brownfield-sites-https-digital-land-github-io-project-brownfield-sites)**

We made a [prototype map](https://digital-land.github.io/brownfield-sites-map/) of the data collected so far.

**[27 September 2019](https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/2019-09-27/#brownfield-sites-https-digital-land-github-io-project-brownfield-sites)**

We began work on a nightly collection process, starting with the brownfield sites collector.

**15 June 2019**

We met again with [Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE)](https://cpre.org.uk/) to further understand how they're using brownfield data and how this might connect to other data sets. We also spoke about our ideas to make it easier for local authorities to collect and publish their data.

**June 2019**

We've been analysing the existing brownfield data to explore whether we can propose a simplified data standard that'll be easier for local authorities to publish against. As a part of this work we've also been looking at what has changed since we last looked at the published registers.

**4 April 2019**

We met with [CPRE](https://cpre.org.uk/) to understand more about how they collected the brownfield data, the challenges they faced, and how they used the data.

**March 2019**

The [CPRE](https://cpre.org.uk/) published the [2019 State of Brownfield annual report](https://www.cpre.org.uk/resources/housing-and-planning/planning/item/5086-state-of-brownfield-2019). In the report they highlighted some of the challenges they faced whilst collecting brownfield data.

**Summer 2018**

We built a [register of all the brownfield registers](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-collector/blob/master/etc/brownfield-site-publication.tsv) and prototyped a tool to [validate the data](https://brownfield-sites-validator.herokuapp.com).
