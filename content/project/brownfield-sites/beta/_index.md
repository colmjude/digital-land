### Guidance on updating your brownfield site data

#### Problem we’re solving

Brownfield land registers published by local planning authorities often contain lots of errors and gaps in the data. The [old data standard](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653657/BrownfieldLandRegisters_-_DataStandard.pdf) was long and difficult to follow.

#### Our solution

We published [new guidance on publishing brownfield land data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brownfield-land-registers-data-standard/publish-your-brownfield-land-data) on GOV.UK. By writing clear, simple, user-centred guidance, we believe that the quality of data being published will improve.

#### Iterations we’re making

We’re currently testing this guidance and continuously improving it based on user feedback.

An example of recent improvements is to make clearer what users should do when entries in their registers are no longer considered to be brownfield land, for example if it has been built upon. We added further detail on this point after several users contact us for clarification.

When we make a change that differs from the old data standard, or when we receive several of the same question, we are detailing our reasoning behind decisions on our [data principles](https://digital-land.github.io/guidance/data-principles/) guidance.


### Brownfield site data validator

#### Problem we’re solving

Brownfield land registers published by local planning authorities often contain lots of errors and gaps in the data. By running a register through a validator before publishing, users will be able to find and manually correct errors. We believe this will improve the quality of the data being published.

#### Our solution

[Brownfield land data validator](https://brownfield-sites-validator.herokuapp.com/).


#### Iterations we’re making

We have improved the content, making the user interface more clear, simple and accessible.

We’re currently testing and iterating our prototype to improve the user experience.


### A way of fixing errors

#### Problem we’re solving

Many of the errors we identified in published brownfield data were common mistakes, such as switching GeoX and GeoY coordinates, or date formatting.

#### Our solution

Some of these errors are quite easy to fix automatically, and we believe that offering to automatically fix common errors after validating a register may improve the data. We have built this into the validator:

* a [validation tool](https://brownfield-sites-validator.herokuapp.com/) for brownfield sites

#### Iterations we’re making

We’re currently testing and iterating our prototype to improve the user experience.
